**Never miss a Valorant queue again.**

ValoNotifier is a lightweight, open-source tool that sends **Discord notifications** to your phone when your match is found. It is designed for players who want to step away from their PC (grab a drink, bathroom break, stretch) without worrying about missing the queue or accidentally dodging.

## ✨ Features
* **Queue Detection:** Instant alerts for all modes (Unrated, Competitive, Swiftplay, TDM, etc.).
* **Map Preview:** See the map name while away (useful for strategic dodges).
* **Live Mobility:** Get pinged on your phone via the Discord app.
* **Lock-In Timer:** A live countdown showing an estimated minimum of how much time you have left to pick an agent.
* **Safe & Local:** Runs entirely on your PC using the Riot Local Client API. No passwords or external API keys required.
