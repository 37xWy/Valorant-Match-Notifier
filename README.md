# 🔔 ValoNotifier

**Never miss a Valorant queue again.**

ValoNotifier is a lightweight, open-source tool that sends **Discord notifications** to your phone when your match is found. It is designed for players who want to step away from their PC (grab a drink, bathroom break, stretch) without worrying about missing the queue or accidentally dodging.

## ✨ Features
* **Queue Detection:** Instant alerts for all modes (Unrated, Competitive, Swiftplay, TDM, etc.).
* **Map Preview:** See the map name **before** you load in (useful for strategic dodges).
* **Live Mobility:** Get pinged on your phone via the Discord app.
* **Lock-In Timer:** A live countdown showing an estimated minimum of how much time you have left to pick an agent.
* **Safe & Local:** Runs entirely on your PC using the Riot Local Client API. No passwords or external API keys required.

## 🚀 How to Use
1.  Download `ValoNotifier.exe` from the **[Releases Page](../../releases)**.
2.  Run the app (no additional installation required).
3.  Paste your **Discord Webhook URL** when asked.
4.  Minimize the window and go AFK!
